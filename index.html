    <p>Everyday the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene releases data indicating the percentage of New Yorkers that have been partially and fully vaccinated against COVID-19, but Public Health and Health Policy experts say that some of the vaccination rates reported by the city may be inaccurate.
    </p>

    <p> "In general, public infrastructure has been severely under invested and as a result, our ability to track important health events such as COVID cases like COVID vaccination is compromised," said Denis Nash, a Distinguished Professor Executive Director at the CUNY Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health. "When thinking about the accuracy of the information that comes into and out of these surveillance systems and with any public health surveillance system, you have to think about the possibility of both under-counting and over counting." </p>

    <p> According to Prof. Nash, some of the vaccination rates reported by the city are also mathematically impossible to achieve, "When you look at data and see 95% of people in a given zip code have received at least one dose, it's probably not 95%. And in some cases, more than a hundred percent of the population is vaccinated, which is a little bit impossible, right?" </p>
